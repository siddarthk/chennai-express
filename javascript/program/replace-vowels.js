    Replace a with 1, e with 2 , i with 3 , o with 4 and u with 5 and others remain as is
    Example name -> n1m2 , vowel -> v4w2l
    Handle conditions where an invalid string is passed and the result should be and empty string '' 
    
    Points to Remember:     
        Put your logic only between the code goes here
        Don't remove existing code
        Return the result 
        It's better if you clean the code before handing over

        navigate to command line
        type the commands node replace-vowels -a <your input with angular bracket>
