    PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU PROCEED

    Have the function test() take the input parameter being passed and return the 
    largest word in the string. If there are two or more words that are the same length, 
    return the first word from the string with that length. 
    Ignore special characters and assume input will not be empty. 

    Points to Remember:     
        Put your logic only between logic block
        Don't remove existing code
        Return the result 
        It's better if you clean the code before handing over

    Test your program:
        navigate to command line
        type the commands node longest-word -a <your input with angular bracket>
        Example : node longest-word -a i need to find the longest word    
*/

function test(input) { 
    /* code goes here */

    
    /* code goes here */
}

module.exports = {
    test
}

require('./cli').run(test);
