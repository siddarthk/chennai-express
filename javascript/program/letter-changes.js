    PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU PROCEED

    Have the function test(input) take the input parameter being passed and modify it using the following algorithm. 
    Replace every letter in the string with the letter following it in the alphabet 
    (ie. c becomes d, z becomes a). Then capitalize every vowel in this new string (a, e, i, o, u) 
    and finally return this modified string. Ignore anything else
    charCodeAt fromCharCode could be handy
    
    Points to Remember:     
        Put your logic only between the code goes here
        Don't remove existing code
        Return the result 
        It's better if you clean the code before handing over

    Test your program:
        navigate to command line
        type the commands node letter-changes -a <your input with angular bracket>
        Example : node letter-changes -a mystring

module.exports = {

require('./cli').run(test);
