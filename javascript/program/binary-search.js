    sorted array, don't use built in methods
    implement the binary search
    // A binary search based function to find the position 
    // where item should be inserted in a[low..high] 

    
    Points to Remember:     
        Put your logic only between the code goes here
        Don't remove existing code
        Return the result 
        It's better if you clean the code before handing over

    Test your program:
        navigate to command line
        type the commands node replace-vowels -a <your input with angular bracket>
        Example : node binary-search -a input
