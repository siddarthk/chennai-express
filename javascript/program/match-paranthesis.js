    PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU PROCEED

    Have the function test(input) take the input parameter being passed as sentence (string). 
    Balance the parenthesis and return the new sentence, don't pad with spaces
    ex: this is (test -> this is (test)
    ex: this is (another (test) -> this is (another (test))

    
    Points to Remember:     
        Put your logic only between the code goes here
        Don't remove existing code
        Return the result 
        It's better if you clean the code before handing over

    Test your program:
        navigate to command line
        type the commands node match-paranthesis -a <your input with angular bracket>
        Example : node match-paranthesis -a mystring

function test(input) { 
    /* logic block */
    
    
    /* logic block */
}

module.exports = {
    test
}

require('./cli').run(test);
